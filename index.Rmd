# ENSC 430 Overview

Welcome to ENSC 430 Honours Project in Environmental Sustainability - ENSC 430. In this course you will:

* Evaluate effectiveness of different climate change mitigation measures
* Monitor current trends, evaluate model performance, assess future projections
* Evaluate climate change impacts
* Use AI to imporve models

The skills you will learn will prepare you for your future job in government, academia, or the private sector. For more information, please download the [syllabus](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vUuUg12YwXrV9h7bQcze_E3fofkN1ZZK/view?usp=sharing).
