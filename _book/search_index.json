R is a command line driven program. The user enters commands at the prompt and each command is executed one at a time. RStudio is a Graphic User Interface for R. For this course, you will first need to install R and then RStudio If you already have R or RStudio installed, please install them again to ensure you have the most recent version Install R from here Install RStudio from here Once R and RStudio are installed, open RStudio and learn the basic R syntax following the exercises below. 2.1 Create a new Project Open RStudio Click on File in the upper-left corner From the drop-down list choose New Project ..., New Directory, Browse... and choose a directory of your project. For instance, in my case this will be C:\\Users\\seile\\Documents\\queensu\\teaching\\classes\\ENSC430\\tutorials\\ENSC430. Important: make sure your directory does not include white space or special characters. Go to your new directory and create a new folder called renv. This is where you will store your packages, as explained next. 2.2 Set up your computational environment In the lower-left panel you find your console where you can execute commands. Your first task is to set up your computational environment using the command .libPaths() In the Console, type the command below using the directory of your project. Note that you need to use / rather than \\. # Set your working directory: setwd(&quot;C:/Users/seile/Documents/queensu/teaching/classes/ENSC430/tutorials/ENSC430&quot;) # Tell R where to store your packages: .libPaths(&quot;C:/Users/seile/Documents/queensu/teaching/classes/ENSC430/tutorials/ENSC430/renv&quot;) You can check if all went well by typing .libPaths(). Does it return your directory? If yes, then continue. Next you will install your first package called renv install.packages(&quot;renv&quot;) renv::init() Next, install rmarkdown: install.packages(&quot;rmarkdown&quot;) R Markdown allows you to integrate code, figures, and text. You will write your report in R Markdown. install.packages(&quot;bookdown&quot;) 2.3 Syntax In R, you use the following syntax to to assign a value to a variable. x &lt;- 1 print(x) The variable x used above is an example of an R object. The print statement prints the value of the object x. Once you assign values to R objects, you can use the following arithmetic operators to perform calculations. a &lt;- 2 b &lt;- 3 # Addition c &lt;- a+b print(c) # Subtraction c &lt;- a-b print(c) # Multiplication c &lt;- a*b print(c) # Division c &lt;- a/b print(c) # Exponentiation c &lt;- a^b print(c) Note that anything after the # symbol is ignored. a &lt;- 2 b &lt;- 3 c &lt;- a + b # c &lt;- (a + b)^2 print(c) This way you can add comments into your code that to explain what you are doing 2.4 Objects All objects have two intrinsic attributes: mode and length. The mode is the basic type of the elements of the object. There are four main modes: numeric, character, complex, and logical (FALSE or TRUE). a &lt;- 5 class(a) a &lt;- &quot;apple&quot; class(a) a &lt;- 1 + 2i class(a) a &lt;- TRUE class(a) The length of an object is the number of elements of the object. a &lt;- 2 length(a) ## [1] 1 a &lt;- c(2,7,5) length(a) ## [1] 3 Next to mode and length, there are different types of objects, namely vector, factor, array, matrix, data frame, and list # Vector with one element a &lt;- 2 print(a) # Vector with four elements b &lt;- c(7,5,2,9) print(b) # Data frame x &lt;- c(3,7,2,4) y &lt;- c(42,67,21,33) df &lt;- data.frame(x, y) print(df) # Matrix: in R, a matrix has 2 dimensions only) x &lt;- c(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10) a &lt;- matrix(x, nrow = 2) print(a) # Array: an array has more than 2 dimensions x &lt;- c(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9) a &lt;- array(data = x, dim = c(3,3,3)) print(a) # List a &lt;- c(3,2,5,6) b &lt;- c(TRUE, FALSE) c &lt;- c(&quot;apples&quot;, &quot;pears&quot;, &quot;plums&quot;) d &lt;- 5 l &lt;- list(a,b,c,d) print(l) 2.5 Generating data # Sequence from 1 to 10 with step size 1 x &lt;- 1:10 print(x) # Sequence from 1 to 10 with step size 0.5 x &lt;- seq(1, 10, 0.5) print(x) # Vector that repeats the value one for ten times x &lt;- rep(1, 10) print(x) # Random sequences with uniform distribution between zero and one x &lt;- runif(n = 5, min = 0, max = 1) print(x) 2.6 Plot data x &lt;- seq(1:10) y &lt;- x^2 plot(x, y) "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
